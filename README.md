# BearTree
My implementation of a Left-Leaning Reb-Black Tree written from scratch using modern C++ principles, such 
as smart pointers and move semantics. The tree is using a queue that i wrote, which is using a linked list 
that i wrote, which are included in the include/ directory. 

# Build
to build, simply create a build directory and run cmake
```
    mkdir build
    cd build 
    cmake .. 
    make
    rbtree 
```
